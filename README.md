# OddIsoGrass

A [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) notebook to prove exceptionality and fullness of collections of homogeneous bundles on odd isotropic Grassmannians IGr(3,2n+1).

In particular, the notebook [IGr(3,11)_LefschetzBasis](https://github.com/ZenoCozeno/oddisoGrass/blob/main/IGr(3%2C11)_LefschetzBasis.ipynb) shows how to prove the existence of a Lefschetz collection on IGr(3,11).

The code can be useful for other algebraic geometers interested in the study of derived categories of odd isotropic Grassmannians from a computational viewpoint. For a detailed understanding of the theoretical background and the broader context of this work, I recommend referring to my thesis (link incoming).

## Installation

To use the functions in this notebook, you don't need to install anything special. You can run the notebook on your local machine if you have SageMath >= 9.4 [installed](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html). The modules are written in Python, but they must be run in the Python distribution bundled with your SageMath installation.

## Usage

Check out the notebook [IGr(3,11)_LefschetzBasis](https://github.com/ZenoCozeno/oddisoGrass/blob/main/IGr(3%2C11)_LefschetzBasis.ipynb) to see a working example.
