# oddisoGrass

A SageMath notebook (https://www.sagemath.org) to prove exceptionality and fullness of collections of homogeneous bundles on odd isotropic Grassmannians IGr(3,2n+1).

In particular, the notebook [IGr(3,11)_LefschetzBasis](https://github.com/ZenoCozeno/oddisoGrass/blob/main/IGr(3%2C11)_LefschetzBasis.ipynb) shows how to prove the existence of a Lefschetz collection on IGr(3,11).

We think that the code can be useful for other algebraic geometers interested in the study of derived categories of odd isotropic Grassmannians from a computational viewpoint.

## Installation

To use the functions in this notebook, you don't need to install anything special. You can run the notebook on your local machine if you have SageMath > 9.4 installed.

## Usage

Check out the notebook [IGr(3,11)_LefschetzBasis](https://github.com/ZenoCozeno/oddisoGrass/blob/main/IGr(3%2C11)_LefschetzBasis.ipynb) to see a working example.


Please refer to the author's thesis and (arxiv-link) (sec. 1.4-1.5-1.6) for further detail on the implementation and the problem.
