# oddisoGrass

Code to prove exceptionality and fullness of collections of homogeneous bundles on odd isotropic Grassmannians IGr(3,2n+1).

THe purpose of this repo is to provide the code to justify the claims in the author's thesis (sec. 1.6).
These computations are performed to show the functionalities of the different functions in the notebook 
IGr(3,11)_Lefschetz. 

Furthermore, we think that the code can be useful for other algebraic geometers interested in the study of derived categories of (odd) isotropic Grassmannians.

Please refer to the author's thesis and (arxiv-link) (sec. 1.4-1.5-1.6) for further detail on the implementation and the problem.
